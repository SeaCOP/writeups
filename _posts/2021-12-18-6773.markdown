SPD released a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xf2DLAf3hM)
that claimed to show the fatal shooting of a car jacking suspect. The
video was edited to appear to depict the point where the suspect was
killed.

But according to an [OPA complaint](https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/OPA/ClosedCaseSummaries/2016OPA-0462ccs10-26-16MA.pdf),
the part where the suspect was actually killed actually happend
several minutes later.
